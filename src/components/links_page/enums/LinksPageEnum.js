        TITLE: "Filament Quality Control System",
        DESCRIPTION: `<span>Python-based back-end system</span> designed to communicate with a <span>PLC controller</span> via <span>TCP
            protocol</span> for real-time <span>filament quality monitoring</span>. The system retrieves spool data by <span>querying a
            PostgreSQL database</span> based on a unique spool ID and displays <span>key quality characteristics</span>, enabling precise
            and efficient quality assurance in filament production.`,

            The application demonstrates basic <span>login and registration functionality</span>, while connecting to an open-source <span>Machine
            Learning API</span> for <span>face recognition</span>. The system showcases practical integration of <span>ML-powered
            authentication</span> for enhancing security and user experience.`,

            The application, created by a team of three during the <span>second year of the university</span>, is integrated with
            a <span>MySQL database</span> for data management. The system requires installed <span>Java runtime</span> for execution
            and was developed to demonstrate core <span>back-end development skills</span>.`,
